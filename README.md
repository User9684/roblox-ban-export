# Roblox Ban Export
This is a utility I wrote for a game I work for, Asylum Life, in which we format private ban reasons matching the regex `Moderator - (\w+)(; .+)?`

With this, I can paginate through bans & output as a CSV mapping banned users to the date they were banned, the duration they were banned, who they were banned by, and for what reason.
